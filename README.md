# Port Scanner

This is a port scanning script written in Python designed to scan open ports on local network computers. The scanner allows the user to input a base IP address and a range of ports to scan, returning the open ports found.

## Description

The scanner checks the specified ports on computers within a local network (e.g., 192.168.x.x). It attempts to connect to each port in the given range and reports whether the port is open.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Download the code by cloning the Git repository:
   ```bash
  
Usage:
python port_scanner.py

Enter the base IP (e.g., ) and the port range (e.g., 1/1024).
Click "Start Scan" to begin the scanning process.
